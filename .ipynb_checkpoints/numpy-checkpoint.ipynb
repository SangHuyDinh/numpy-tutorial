In contrast to Python's built-in list data structure (which, despite the name, is a dynamic array), these arrays are homogeneously typed: all elements of a single array must be of the same type.\n",

    "Such arrays can also be views into memory buffers allocated by C/C++, Cython, and Fortran extensions to the CPython interpreter without the need to copy data around, giving a degree of compatibility with existing numerical libraries. This functionality is exploited by the SciPy package, which wraps a number of such libraries (notably BLAS and LAPACK). NumPy has built-in support for memory-mapped ndarrays.\n",

    "\n",
    "Python’s lists are efficient general-purpose containers. They support (fairly) efficient insertion, deletion, appending, and concatenation, and Python’s list comprehensions make them easy to construct and manipulate. However, they have certain limitations: they don’t support “vectorized” operations like element-wise addition and multiplication, and the fact that they can contain objects of differing types mean that Python must store type information for every element, and must execute type dispatching code when operating on each element. This also means that very few list operations can be carried out by efficient C loops – each iteration would require type checks and other Python API bookkeeping."

You just have to make sure that, as you’re stacking the arrays row-wise, that the number of columns in both arrays is the same. As such, you could also add an array with shape **(2,4)** or **(3,4)** to **my_2d_array**, as long as the number of columns matches. Stated differently, the arrays must have the same shape along all but the first axis. The same holds also for when you want to use **np.r[].**\n",
    "* For **np.hstack()**, you have to make sure that the number of dimensions is the same and that the number of rows in both arrays is the same. That means that you could stack arrays such as **(2,3)** or **(2,4)** to **my_2d_array**, which itself as a shape of **(2,4)**. Anything is possible as long as you make sure that the number of rows matches. This function is still supported by NumPy, but you should prefer **np.concatenate()** or **np.stack()**.\n",
    "* With **np.column_stack()**, you have to make sure that the arrays that you input have the same first dimension. In this case, both shapes are the same, but if my_resized_array were to be **(2,1)** or **(2,)**, the arrays still would have been stacked.\n",
